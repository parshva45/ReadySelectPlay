Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin.

Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\u0026#10;  \u0026#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M3fRcs2sKpffc7Yl1KXodvbBa5Q=/0x0/pic1798136.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eqDi6VPAU3XUvDDhqur97X2umO0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1798136.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":6.53988,"averageRating":6.73378,"rank":852,"__v":0,"complexity":"Light","category":"Adventure"}

They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/piCwuSe5_1MFafvZlwloUuWAnmo=/0x0/pic451308.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/IK7_PyF10t9TbKXPwDlpYsRIc-o=/fit-in/200x150/pic451308.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1986,"bggRating":5.50236,"averageRating":5.58307,"rank":13472,"__v":0,"complexity":"Medium Light","category":"Fighting"}

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)\u0026mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone\u0026mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u0026mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/A-0yDJkve0avEicYQ4HoNO-HkK8=/0x0/pic2419375.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/g8LvJsd2oLAub6AEKN_Xpdoi8Sw=/fit-in/200x150/pic2419375.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1995,"bggRating":7.04638,"averageRating":7.1997,"rank":315,"__v":0,"complexity":"Medium Heavy","category":"Deduction"}
