Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\u0026#10;  \u0026#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M3fRcs2sKpffc7Yl1KXodvbBa5Q=/0x0/pic1798136.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eqDi6VPAU3XUvDDhqur97X2umO0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1798136.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":6.53988,"averageRating":6.73378,"rank":852,"__v":0,"complexity":"Light","category":"Adventure"}

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/kjE_203UAzAopd1voyWKAvXqFHw=/0x0/pic260745.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/v4iQ22pft-lihR4m0D9aid05qLE=/fit-in/200x150/pic260745.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1475,"bggRating":6.92498,"averageRating":7.09819,"rank":427,"__v":0,"complexity":"Medium Light","category":"Bluffing"}

Players collect these resources (cards)\u0026mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone\u0026mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u0026mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/A-0yDJkve0avEicYQ4HoNO-HkK8=/0x0/pic2419375.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/g8LvJsd2oLAub6AEKN_Xpdoi8Sw=/fit-in/200x150/pic2419375.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1995,"bggRating":7.04638,"averageRating":7.1997,"rank":315,"__v":0,"complexity":"Medium Heavy","category":"Deduction"}

The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, they must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;(From Gamewire and Spielbox)\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This game is part of the Carcassonne series.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/I1dMOhvR9-dmrQxsvfL_lGNZfyY=/0x0/pic134384.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/W6A0MG4rdacV_jBgWFNWbs_weUo=/fit-in/200x150/pic134384.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":30,"complexity":"Medium Light","category":"Medieval","isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2005,"bggRating":6.10126,"averageRating":6.49613,"rank":1819}

Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.\u0026#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;From the publisher's website:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island!

Robotech RPG Tactics is a tactical miniatures game set in the Robotech universe. While the 1/285th scale game pieces can be used as a companion to the Robotech RPG, the game system is designed to be played as a tabletop miniatures game. Players build armies of multiple squadrons of mecha to fight it out in scenario-driven, objective-based game play. Take command of the fighting forces of the United Earth Defense Force (UEDF) valiantly defending Earth from alien annihilation \u0026ndash; or lead the massive clone armies of the Zentraedi Armada to recover an alien artifact of immense power and enslave humankind. Depending on the faction, and their choice of mecha, a player's army may include anywhere from two game pieces to as many as you desire! The rules are scalable from small skirmishes to mass combat with hundreds per side.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Robotech RPG Tactics uses a dynamic turn system. Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army. By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening. Each player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes. Even the battlefield itself can alter over the course of the game as buildings are leveled by destruction unleashed during the battle.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/LI-3YlL8xZ-mnAKQh0UvU48V-cY=/0x0/pic1640685.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/qfmwEZpYvk8X57Q_n21CbEntZwE=/fit-in/200x150/pic1640685.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":0,"playingTime":180,"complexity":"Medium","category":"Science Fiction","isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2014,"bggRating":5.48599,"averageRating":5.18815,"rank":14977,"expansions":[{"name":"Robotech RPG Tactics: UEDF Spartan/Phalanx Destroids","gameId":170307},{"name":"Robotech RPG Tactics: UEDF Tomahawk / Defender Destroids","gameId":202200},{"name":"Robotech RPG Tactics: UEDF Valkyrie Wing","gameId":170308},{"name":"Robotech RPG Tactics: Zentraedi Artillery Battlepods","gameId":202873},{"name":"Robotech RPG Tactics: Zentraedi Glaug Command Pack","gameId":203804},{"name":"Robotech RPG Tactics: Zentraedi Regult Battlepod Squadron","gameId":170309}]}

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D\u0026amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in \u0026quot;bad stuff\u0026quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the \u0026quot;big announcement.\u0026quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details.

The suspense builds as your men move deeper into enemy territory. Move with caution and courage. The next piece you attack could be a bomb.

It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Re-implemented by:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire \u0026amp; Ice)\u0026#10;     The Generals\u0026#10;     Stratego Legends\u0026#10;     Stratego: Star Wars\u0026#10;     Stratego: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition\u0026#10;     Ultimate Stratego\u0026#10;     Electronic Stratego\u0026#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes\u0026#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition\u0026#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;and numerous others.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Similar to:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Admirals\u0026#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi\u0026#10;    L'Attaque\u0026#10;    Attack\u0026#10;    Batalj\u0026#10;    Sharpe's Attack\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Different Edition Complications\u0026#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.\u0026#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....\u0026#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.\u0026#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.\u0026#10;This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D\u0026amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away.
