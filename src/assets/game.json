Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves.  A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds.  To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gameplay:  Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point).\u0026#10;  \u0026#10;     The round proceeds in 2 stages.  The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need).  These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively.  After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities.  Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand.  This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought.  Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols.  The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain.  For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest).  Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed).  The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across.  Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round.  Each player plays his cards and moves his elf-boot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited.  If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round.  This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner.  If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens.  The person with the highest score wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/M3fRcs2sKpffc7Yl1KXodvbBa5Q=/0x0/pic1798136.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eqDi6VPAU3XUvDDhqur97X2umO0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1798136.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":6.53988,"averageRating":6.73378,"rank":852,"__v":0}

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)\u0026mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone\u0026mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities\u0026mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's \u0026quot;registers\u0026quot; with facedown movement cards.

Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged.

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map.\u0026#10;To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the half-humans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played.\u0026#10;The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises.

Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 \u0026amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 \u0026amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 \u0026amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn\u0026rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn\u0026rsquo;s progress lost.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/KhE25akKpyfWirTyNTqThTidb0o=/0x0/pic1046518.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/NjaP7QhJGtEx30UAT_rvTC6WBuw=/fit-in/200x150/pic1046518.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1980,"bggRating":6.69695,"averageRating":6.84697,"rank":669,"__v":0}

Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris \u0026amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This \u0026quot;ziggurat expansion\u0026quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Some versions of Tigris \u0026amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

The game consists of a single deck of cards of rank 2\u0026ndash;10 in 5 different colors with 3 special \u0026quot;handshakes\u0026quot; (\u0026quot;HS\u0026quot; in scoring examples below) in each suit. There is also a board which functions only to hold and organize discarded cards and is largely superfluous. Games last around 15 minutes. This is generally considered a good \u0026quot;couples\u0026quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40.

The game utilizes both a strategic layer of the conflict but also provides a slightly more tactical layer of combat with additional battle maps that allow for center, and flank positions of specific units.  The game can be combined with Bobby Lee so that both theaters of the Civil War can be played out at the same time.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a \u0026quot;fog of war\u0026quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it\u0026rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number.

The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like \u0026mdash; except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest non-trump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down.

The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two face-up colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down.

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. \u0026quot;The 9-8-7,\u0026quot; for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 9-8-7. This is repeated until the boards are filled.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Zp_PgfjSH-akY9rbJPBG1CLb7zA=/0x0/pic3108440.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/CmKNLEV9pfgn_rF2uWLTI1oVZ0E=/fit-in/200x150/pic3108440.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":20,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1983,"bggRating":6.23711,"averageRating":6.61829,"rank":1451,"__v":0}

The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring \u0026ldquo;Corner on Wheat!\u0026rdquo; or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Pit\u0026rsquo;s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt\u0026rsquo;s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is     US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse, a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/6Bk_0RHFu1863OEWAa27XBmv1-Y=/0x0/pic423644.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/FqCwVugUO3tJHAjUX-709PWXI5I=/fit-in/200x150/pic423644.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1903,"bggRating":6.23754,"averageRating":6.39597,"rank":1450,"__v":0}

Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to \u0026quot;steal\u0026quot;.

Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/QjQ8mt0yct1GPJtDKFn4c8do1Yo=/0x0/pic436693.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/hG2hqrUaQbp-itoTGc1G3CTi7SI=/fit-in/200x150/pic436693.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":180,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1982,"bggRating":6.43097,"averageRating":6.92846,"rank":1027,"__v":0}

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway.

One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The earliest mention of Go (\u0026#229;\u0026#156;\u0026#141;\u0026#230;\u0026#163;\u0026#139; (w\u0026eacute;i q\u0026iacute;)- \u0026quot;surrounding game\u0026quot;) appears in the \u0026quot;Analects\u0026quot; of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17\u0026times;17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/bCv9Y06nWX1rt7Qn1GuCEOyDov0=/0x0/pic1728832.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/jldK9or5F1ke_hBn_jd-Rbnl1F8=/fit-in/200x150/pic1728832.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":180,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":-2200,"bggRating":7.36675,"averageRating":7.65164,"rank":128,"__v":0}

Gameplay is not clockwise, but happens from top to bottom in the politburo. Whatever action the politician in a certain office can take is done by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Actions include accusing other politicians of espionage (potentially exiling them to Siberia), pardoning them, reshuffling the politburo and others. But each action a politician takes lets him (or in one case, her) age by one or more years. Once a turn each politburo member must face a health roll which can result in sickness marker or even instant death (the older, the most likely). At the end of each turn, the reigning head of state must wave to the crowd at the October parade without collapsing (which gets harder the sicker the politician is). A politician who succeeds in this three times makes the player who controls him/her the winner.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance.

These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player.

The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;1) Purchase properties, as described above;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or\u0026#10;\u0026#10;3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/JcAKPuR-EKAbw_RkVDMUnnmf0a4=/0x0/pic58613.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/SdbZjDhh6bxQAivvztlIWD9S5vo=/fit-in/200x150/pic58613.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":25,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1965,"bggRating":5.55102,"averageRating":5.79858,"rank":8775,"__v":0}

In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) \u0026amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (\u0026quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool\u0026quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (\u0026quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!\u0026quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/WTEZCCbIWXeAVM7Sf1QC_BeRrGI=/0x0/pic1300663.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/seZ4TKS8fsRYm_R3I4pnDplcGg0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1300663.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":30,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1997,"bggRating":5.57949,"averageRating":6.20093,"rank":7124,"__v":0}

Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the pre-WW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history.  Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out.  At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gameplay:  Each player selects a color and takes all pieces of that color, as there are different miniatures for each of the 7 Epochs, these should be sorted by Epoch.  The game board is a stylized version of the globe.  The Event cards should be separated into Greater and Lesser Events.  Each player is dealt 3 Greater Events. These are either Minor Empires, Leaders, Weaponry or Reallocation.  Each player is also dealt 7 Lesser Events.  There are 22 different types of Lesser Events (Disasters, Diseases, and Special abilities, to name a few).  Players roll 2 dice and determine first player and begin drawing their first Epoch empires.  One unique mechanism is that the drawing player can examine their drawn empire and decide whether to keep it for themselves or give it to another player who hasn't gotten one yet.  If it is given to another player, the receiving player has no choice but to keep it for himself to play that Epoch.  Then the next player draws and makes his decision.  The player who gives their drawn Empire has to wait until given an empire by another player or until the last player draws.  Each Empire card contains the Empire name, how many troops the Empire has for expansion, the Empire's starting land space, if it has a Capitol or not (barbarian or nomadic nations frequently do not) and if it has any Navigation (Seas and Oceans to travel by).  One player reads out the Epochs Empires in order and turns are taken, in this roughly historical order, when a player's Empire is called.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand.  The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions.  If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them).  A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop).  If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer.  To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it.  Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from.  In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well.  If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense.  Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker.  In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the now-empty land space.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort.  On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land.  Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues.  Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered).  After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Then scoring takes place.  Each area (Middle-East, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch.  One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land).  Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area).  These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (Middle-East is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example).  Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board.  Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a pre-eminence marker and places it in front of him.  These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then.  This bonus to leader helps balance the Empire-draw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory: After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a pre-eminence marker, all players reveal their pre-eminence markers and add them to their scores.  The player with the highest score wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#10;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;Online Play\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    http://gamesbyemail.com (English, turn-based)\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#10;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;\u0026#9;===========\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Contents of 1993 AH edition:\u0026#10;6 page rules folder\u0026#10;6 page sample game folder\u0026#10;32\u0026quot; x 22\u0026quot; mounted mapboard\u0026#10;6 x 96 army markers (25 I/V, 4 I/IV, 20 II/VI, 30 III/VII, 5 IV/VII,\u0026#10;6 IV/VI, 6 IV/V)\u0026#10;6 x 6 Monuments\u0026#10;6 x 7 Fleets\u0026#10;6 x 1 VP marker\u0026#10;20 Forts/Fortresses\u0026#10;28 Capital/City markers\u0026#10;4 Sumerian Armies\u0026#10;five six sided dice\u0026#10;64 Event cards\u0026#10;48 Empire cards\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/JGI_nL7aUYlgoXGBGUWZOiSKD4s=/0x0/pic287451.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Vo6G-RXYq8zI2Y6t8k5CwMr-dYU=/fit-in/200x150/pic287451.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":180,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1991,"bggRating":6.71368,"averageRating":7.12601,"rank":650,"__v":0}

The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity - the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The Game\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each players assume the role of one of those four city-states. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and city-states. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered \u0026quot;full\u0026quot;), the four starting city-states are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports - between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/fnndI8CiJJNuPBEbEVstig7XIPY=/0x0/pic322925.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/NPhNTDq5uycPrKcdGhtH1Wr6Hh0=/fit-in/200x150/pic322925.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1996,"bggRating":6.33877,"averageRating":6.87271,"rank":1212,"__v":0}

Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers.

When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second \u0026quot;what-if\u0026quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle.

Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as \u0026quot;Flank Attack\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Cavalry Charge\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Assault\u0026quot;, while the defensive options are things such as \u0026quot;Refuse Flanks\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Squares Formed\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;Reverse Slopes\u0026quot;.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Itbp3AhCtUVmD4d9G1jb1c_SiaI=/0x0/pic16960.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/dvlOljzwBvvBDT5_5D_8PW0-tkc=/fit-in/200x150/pic16960.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":7,"playingTime":240,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1997,"bggRating":5.5378,"averageRating":6.38462,"rank":9864,"__v":0}

There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),\u0026#10;     a bonus resource,\u0026#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and\u0026#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     \u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table.

Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.

In the box are fourteen games themed on ancient Rome. The games are themed to cover, albeit in a highly abstract fashion, the rise of Rome, the Roman Republic and finally, the Empire.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;(7 of the games are described below)\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The Wheel of History : 2-5 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This is an early version of what was to become Bunte Runde. 25 cards are laid out in a large circle, representing the tribes to be united under early Rome. Players may advance a pawn one, two or three spaces forwards and collect a card. Cards are scored on face value, but there are some quirks that vary this.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The Seven Hills of Rome : 2 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This is one of the easier games in the compendium. The theme here is you are battling your opponent for control of the seven hills of Rome. The hills are represented by seven cards, numbered 1 to 7, laid out between the players. Cards are played from a hand against the 'hills' in an attempt to influence them to your side. You sum the hills you control at the end of the game, and the highest total wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Mercator : 3-7 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This game is Medici's ancestor. It is a simplified version of Medici, with the chief differences being you can hold six cards on your ship, and you are competing for highest value totals only. The number of each suit taken is meaningless, except in a variant where you get paid a bonus if you get one of each. The game lasts only one round. Medici is worth purchasing on its own, but this is still worth a look.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Imperium : 3-5 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The aim is to earn points for control of each of the 9 areas on the board. The game lasts 9 turns, and at the end of each turn, the area matching the turn number is evaluated for control and points are awarded. On your turn, 3 cards are revealed simultaneously. These cards are numbered 1 to 9, with 2 additional banner cards. The numbers correspond to the areas you want to place control markers into. The banner cards indicate you want one or two extra chips placed in the indicated area. After control markers are placed, the current turn's area is evaluated - points being awarded to the winner and perhaps the second and third places as well. After 9 turns, the player with the most points wins. As you progress, the points awarded for each area increases, giving a nice feeling of acceleration.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Senator : 2-3 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;You play a Roman faction trying to position your people (a hand of cards) into the senate. They can only get their via the senate steps. The board is a grid of 5x5 spaces, The 9 spaces in the center are the senate, while 12 of the remaining 16 are the steps spaces that run around the perimeter of the senate. Cards are placed initially on the steps, and then pushed into the senate by placing more cards on the steps.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Circus Maximus : 3-5 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A simple chariot racing game where players are competing to be the first to get their team of three chariots around the hex map circuit and onto the podium. Each player has a set of cards face up in front of them, numbered 1 to 5. To move a chariot they select up to three cards per chariot which that is the movement allowance for that piece. The movement off each card must be in a straight line, so some rather clumsy cornering ability is built into the game. Cards used by a chariot are turned face down, becoming unavailable for the other chariots still to move. Each chariot must be moved at least once per turn, if possible. Therefore, the trick is to maximize your movement with your 15 points each turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Consul : 2-4 players\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This is an intriguing memory game, that, like most of the games in this compendium, have a hard time being fitted into a theme! Twenty-five cards are turned face down in a grid. Players start the game each holding three cards in their hand. On their turn, players make a bid to take a turn. The highest bid gets to turn up cards until they choose to finish, or make a mistake. Cards in a set can be of the same value, or same color, or both. The value of the set must equal of exceed the bid made, simply by summing the face values of the cards. If a mistake is made, the cards are turned face down, and the player must discard a card from their hand into the grid. If the bid is made, the cards are taken into the players hand. At the end of the game, the highest total held wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;--\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Translated rulebook to the contrary, this game has never been published by an English publisher.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Note: 3 of these have been printed/repackaged in English by GMT in Rome: Imperium, Circus Maximus, Hannibal vs Rome\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/2gaBLhKtxmD5hu90dKpO4CmOB78=/0x0/pic5886.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/v111Gm9PMnQbr-8oHGE4B1qBbKw=/fit-in/200x150/pic5886.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":7,"playingTime":0,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1994,"bggRating":5.67346,"averageRating":6.81693,"rank":4630,"__v":0}

Why did some Empires endure for centuries while others lasted only a few generations?

Each turn (90 years) will see new countries come to the fore, while established empires struggle to levy reinforcements and arrange alliances. A fine line must be walked between conserving one's forces and expanding one's empire. Too much expansion will see your resources spread thin and possibly swept away by a new emerging empire, but not enough aggression will see your empire fail to garner sufficient victory points to win.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Armies are of a mix of foot and mounted units, along with the occasional leader of note.

The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy \u0026amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Eg9tj5NgCZ6y5bgczkSVkDSzbxI=/0x0/pic2042135.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/h8LY2R63vepVBmG_dmu8eAhAG3E=/fit-in/200x150/pic2042135.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1992,"bggRating":5.60025,"averageRating":5.98963,"rank":6329,"__v":0}

The name roughly translates to \u0026quot;Tigers Moving\u0026quot;. It is an abstract strategy game with an asymmetric setup, i.e. a different number of pieces per side (like Hnefatafl and its ilk). One opponent plays four tiger pieces and the other plays twenty goats.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The board bears a passing resemblance to a Chinese Chess board in that the pieces move along lines from intersection to intersection. However, the gameplay is more similar to Alquerque, Checkers or Draughts. At the start of the game, there are four tigers on the board while there are no goats. The goat player places his/her pieces on the board one by one wherever they choose, with the tiger player getting a move between each placing. Once all the goats are on the board, the two players take turns moving one of their pieces one space. A tiger can alternatively capture a single goat by jumping over it in a line  to an empty space. The tigers win if they can capture five goats. The goal for the goats (who cannot make captures) is to hem the tigers in, giving them no opportunity to move or jump.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;It is one variant from a family of similar Asian games played with varying numbers of tigers/leopards/goats/cows/etc and varying board topologies.\u0026#10;See also Cows and Leopards and Fox and Geese.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Games played on exactly the same board layout (same lines connecting the intersections and same size) include the traditional Spanish Alquerque and Fanoron-Dimy, the smaller variant of Fanorona from Madagascar.

If you land on one of your own dice, you bump that die one space in the same direction, possibly leading to another bump or a capture.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Instead of moving, if you have two dice next to one another, you can spend the turn adjusting their values while keeping their sum the same.

The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl\u0026#195;\u0026#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/TOxSczCCA7iK00K0pui5y81X5pA=/0x0/pic194793.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/2zGARE4B3NkhrQ0jlLtNe0pI7eQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic194793.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1985,"bggRating":5.44272,"averageRating":5.37106,"rank":16099,"__v":0}

A very nice mechanic makes the money paid for the stock go into that company's coffers. It is these funds that the company must use to build track, so while you may get a bargin share for $1, that's not much use as it costs $5 to build a track segment. Very clever, and it certainly adds a twist to the old bidding mechanic.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Construct Track: a company's coffers are plundered for funds to build track.

It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gain or lose carrots as you go around the track.  It's a very clever exercise in arithmetic which David Parlett has fashioned into an entertaining and unique perennial favorite.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There have several variations between the multiple prints of Hare \u0026amp; Tortoise by different publishers.  Most variations come from methods of adding randomness that favor lagging player via cards, dice, or dice charts when landing on a Hare square.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;      Parlett Strategic Variant -- The designer's preferred way of playing the Hare square is that \u0026quot;... you can land on them [Hare square], but must miss a turn. This would be the equivalent of the hare taking a nap, as in Aesop's fable.

So with a 60, I can fill a space from 60 to 100, the outside rows effectively, but with a 6, I can play practically anywhere, especially the key points in the center area. The game is for 2-3 players, but works even better when played in partnership, your partner frustrated as you fill high numbers with low cards, you frustrated as your partner fails to block.

Now the tradition continues with Express, a unique card game for the 90's. Reminiscent of classic card games but including new play twists, Express is as easy to learn as rummy. Players start with one or two car trains and build on their meld to maximize points and bonuses. But players must be wary of train wrecks and derailments. Unique play allows partners to pass key cards to each other during the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The cards represent various train cars, freight, passenger and way, diesel locomotives and disasters.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Cards are shuffled and dealt to each player, and remaining cards form a draw pile.  Turns consist of drawing either two cards from the face down draw pile or one face up card from the discard pile, melding cards from one's hand and discarding a card.  Players must end their turns with no more than five cards in their hands.  Players meld cards to form freight trains or passenger trains, or they meld individual way cars.  Freight trains are melded so that all the cars are of the same type, such as box car, tank car or auto carrier.  However, a wild card car can be used to have two types of cars in the same freight train.  Passenger trains may contain any or all of the different types of passenger cars.  Each train needs a locomotive which can be any card placed face down.  There is a locomotive pictured on the back of each card.  During the melding phase of their turn, players may exchange face down locomotive cards with any card in their hand.  This feature allows partners to share cards when the game is played by four or six.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Disaster cards may be played as discards.  They can change the direction of play, allow theft of an opponent's car or wreck an entire train.  Way car cards either absorb the damage of corresponding disasters or remedy them in a fashion similar to the Coup Fourre' of Mille Bornes.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Hands end when a player or partnership \u0026quot;goes out.\u0026quot;  To do this the player's melds must consist of at least one five car train, one four car train and all other trains must be at least three cars long.  The player then melds all but one card which he discards.  Trains and way cars are scored.  Cards left in players hands count against them.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game is played in hands until one player or partnership accumulates the points needed to win.

These flat pieces are the foundations.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Comment from the designer \u0026quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. \u0026amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.\u0026quot;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9PW0FweG2aTAa6CirtZO8FaB99o=/0x0/pic175963.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/7coy1tpr_qbEk4g1go2A9E6Sz40=/fit-in/200x150/pic175963.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":20,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1986,"bggRating":5.99925,"averageRating":6.39648,"rank":2179,"__v":0}

Initially players bet on the horses as they are dealt from the deck, then the horses race on the die roll, the course being 40 spaces. The cards \u0026amp; die have 4 symbols, jockey's hat, boot, horse shoe and horse's head; the head is on the die 3 times, giving it a 50% chance of being rolled. The cards have different values against each symbol, showing how far they move when that symbol is rolled. But the number against the horse's head is always 1 to 7 for the same horse. So Raven Beauty always has a 50% chance of moving 7 spaces, Lagoon Lady moves 4, and poor old Roamin' Emporer goes 1 space. The trick, and it's a good trick, is that the other 3 values vary wildly for the lower horses, making them outside chances to win. One lucky roll and Roamin' Emporer can leap forward 20 places! So do you bet on the steady goers, or take a gamble on the nags? Players take turns to roll the die and choose which horse moves, so with a good roll you move one you've bet on, with a bad roll you move someone else's horse.

The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Like a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have \u0026quot;joker\u0026quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the \u0026quot;DeLuxe\u0026quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.

Players control different expeditions which they equip to explore the Lost World.  Victory is achieved through finding various species of dinosaurs and collecting specimens.  The game comes with a modular board to ensure that no two games are alike, and lots of dinosaur stand-up pieces.  One of the most entertaining parts of the game occurs when a dinosaur chases an expedition back to base camp!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This Avalon Hill game has features beyond most family games that appeals to strategy gamers and increase replayability.  First, the board is modular; the location of all the dinosaur sites and required items is completely random every game.  This sort of feature, unusual before the German games of the 90's, puts Dinosaurs of the Lost World years ahead of its time.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Second, players may influence and interact with other players both indirectly by moving dinosaurs in their path or directly by either trading items amicably or attacking their expedition mercilessly.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Third-The sharp limits set out in the rules on weapons and ammunition force the players to pick their battles carefully and makes each dinosaur encounter thrilling and high stakes.  Followed strictly, the rules give the dinosaurs a real possibility of winning a combat and requires strategic planning from players if they hope to avoid being chased right out of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Fourth- The consequences of losing a dinosaur combat are serious.  During the chase you may lose one or more useful tools and even victory points.  Once you escape from the dinosaur, you are returned to camp and lose your next turn.  Because actions that can be taken in camp are somewhat limited, a lost dinosaur battle completely knocks out one turn and diminishes what can be accomplished in two additional turns.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Finally- The game has excellent style.  The dinosaur areas are displayed in a unique \u0026ldquo;comic book\u0026rdquo; format, allowing for great enjoyment and immersion from all players regardless of age.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/LoRDc4LIazpXth1b-woALS6tD-0=/0x0/pic675608.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/Ra8hFMcXjAmcr1pEqZbt60o1OCk=/fit-in/200x150/pic675608.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1987,"bggRating":5.73159,"averageRating":6.54987,"rank":3877,"__v":0}

Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.

This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.

Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added \u0026quot;rule\u0026quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;, you must say \u0026quot;Loco!\u0026quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.

Players are seeking to make the most money by buying and selling stock in various share companies located on eastern United States map.

The board is composed of hexes a la Settlers of Catan. These hexes are dealt out to the players who may look at them and then deploy them face down one at a time. The players then receive an initial allotment of money. They may spend this money to purchase units for the initial planet-fall. Any money that isn't spent is doubled. Opening strategies are based on buying enough infantry to hold any cities that you can know of (from the hexes dealt) and deploying those infantry to guard those cities.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are also several other components. First, is the tension track. This is essentially a turn marker. Once the tension track is exhausted the game ends. There are also a few off-world locations that provide special bonuses. Military units also make use of the transit and orbit boards. Units in \u0026quot;transit\u0026quot; are moved to \u0026quot;orbit\u0026quot;.

A description of this version:\u0026#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six \u0026#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Al Capone  A description of this version:\u0026#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Other versions/re-themes:\u0026#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme.

When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value.

Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.

The mechanism for Hugo's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Hugo, Hugo moves. This means that with more players in the game, Hugo moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Once Hugo has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room!

As Hugo catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar.

Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race.\u0026#10; Specials: When your coach work, tires and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value.

When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st \u0026amp; 2nd place get prize money.

The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides.

Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero.  The first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;An important part of the game is deck construction, which is done prior to the actual game by selecting what cards are included in a particular deck.  There are nearly 20,000 different cards from which to build your deck!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.  Some cards (creatures, artifacts, and enchantments) stay on the board and continue to affect the game, while others have a one-time effect.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called \u0026quot;the stack,\u0026quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/ikdZhkufC7FFx9v5KEaGpWqo13Y=/0x0/pic163749.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/JTUt9zxnc6WQrGQ_pkkaMP3gtx0=/fit-in/200x150/pic163749.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":20,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1993,"bggRating":7.31467,"averageRating":7.46707,"rank":149,"__v":0}

The four characters are allied in pairs: Lord Fiddlebottom and Colonel Bubble are always partnered against Agent X and Madame Zsa Zsa. Each of the four agents is represented by one of four different figures, with different builds: tall, short, fat, thin. Only one of them represents the actual character controlled by a player. The other three figures represent spies which are friendly to him and that are trying to confuse the opposition.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;On a turn, a player shakes the Phantom of Prophecy randomizer to determine his three available actions, e.g., moving on a land route or a sea route. The player moves his figures, trying to reach spaces already occupied by the other players' figures or the Ambassador. When\u0026#31; figures are in the same space, the current player gets the right to \u0026quot;ask questions\u0026quot; and inspect some of the cards of that player. By deduction and a logical process of elimination, he can draw conclusions as to the identity and intentions of the other players.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The \u0026#31;first goal of every agent is to discover which of the other players is his partner. This partner has the other half of the \u0026quot;code\u0026quot; indicating his secret mission. After discovering (or thinking he has discovered) the real identity of the other players, an agent must trade his secret mission card with his ally. This will reveal the final mission and what must be done to complete it. If either agent on a team completes the mission, both he and his partner win the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There is another character with an important role in the game: the Ambassador. He can be used to get clearer information about the other characters. Everyone wants to meet him because he is well-informed and can be useful to accomplish your purposes, but he can also help your rivals, so do everything you can to keep him far from them.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The 2013 version of Inkognito from Ares Games raises the maximum player count to five by allowing someone to play the Ambassador and move it during his turn. He can still gather clues when the other players question the Ambassador during their turn, and the other players can still gather clues from him. The goal of the Ambassador's player is to know everything about the other characters, guessing their identities and builds. If the Ambassador achieves \u0026quot;perfect knowledge\u0026quot; before a team accomplishes its secret missions, he wins the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/lG_1vJeP86FyICjL8Am6zL5dNmA=/0x0/pic1798812.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/wjhFyqSBpB1sae4O1WFNCg1w3OE=/fit-in/200x150/pic1798812.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1988,"bggRating":6.22452,"averageRating":6.58309,"rank":1485,"__v":0}

Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of \u0026quot;orders.\u0026quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game.

In this game, players are given equal forces consisting of ships, planes and other weapons of modern warfare, including a 'nuke' of sorts.  Each turn, players can move a set number of their pieces based on the chosen piece's movement.  The board is a painfully simple system of orthogonal squares.  Once all moves for a given turn have been written down, all pieces are moved simultaneously.  If more than one force's pieces occupy the same space, then a superiority check is made with each type of piece contributing a set number of strength points (usually inversely related to movement).  The largest force then takes possession of all opposing pieces, making the shift in power quite significant, and the central theme for the remainder of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/O2fY4C84319_6oSRMmr2g4TFkKE=/0x0/pic455935.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/A-R-kJSOHuGrnpSjM--pXNSEYv0=/fit-in/200x150/pic455935.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1981,"bggRating":5.55692,"averageRating":6.00923,"rank":8359,"__v":0}

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy.

There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases?

Players navigate flying dragons from North to South to reach the Golden Volcano.  You start with a set of wind stones marked N, S, O, W, SO, and SW (Ost is German for East).

The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.

As players acquire more WarChest figures, armies will grow, offering a wider range of tactical options.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/4xMzd2FJQzDfHZnf7oaZ0uGKWG8=/0x0/pic12136.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/OoRzYnDVaTN8TagJ_WoKmJEg4jw=/fit-in/200x150/pic12136.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":0,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1999,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":5.77,"rank":-1,"__v":0}

The board is the layout of a house with the mouse-hole on one end and the refrigerator on the other end. Your mice try to get food and your cat tries to stop the other team's mice from doing so. There is a dog counter which can be moved each turn, and you use it to try to go after the opponent's cat. In terms of fighting, you can only fight an enemy (The mouse's enemy is the cat, the dog's enemy is the cat, and the cat's enemies are the mice and the dog). You can also pick up items throughout the house that you can use during combat to modify your strength. If you defeat one of your enemies in combat, it is considered \u0026quot;Clobbered\u0026quot; and cannot function until the next turn.

Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase.

The entire game is made from wood, in a light, clear stain, including the over-sized game board.  Each turn is four seasons, and play continues until all six pieces of the ornate castle are placed.  Players use their resource tiles to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available. Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build Charlemagne's castle.  There are slight rules differences between this game and Krieg und Frieden, but mostly a reduction of agenda cards to shorten the game (for the better usually).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Re-implemented by:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Krieg und Frieden\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/XMmC8JaQi8m8uEjztIXhnTohgyM=/0x0/pic556.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/aIye95PY6xZnIgytGUhRhBn4vWY=/fit-in/200x150/pic556.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":5.51903,"averageRating":6.21471,"rank":11786,"__v":0}

Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray \u0026quot;political power\u0026quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead.

Each player is the manager of one of the six companies, which are supposed to be manufacturers competing in the same market with identical products.

The player is responsible for setting the sale price of his product, buying machines to automate production, and buying or selling stock in any of the six companies.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The object of each round--usually--is to charge as much as you can for your product without charging too much more than everyone else. Every turn starts with the players secretly setting the price for their product. The person who has charged the least gets to sell. The one who has charged next-to-least also gets to sell--as long as his price wasn't more than 1,000 DM above the person below him. In fact, as long as there isn't a 1,000 DM gap between one player's price and the next, every player gets to sell. But any player who has charged over 1,000 DM more than his next-lowest competitor--and all players who charged more than him--gets locked out of the market.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The prices on the stock market vary depending on who got to sell and who didn't.

Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there\u0026rsquo;s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they\u0026rsquo;re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn\u0026rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen. The high score after all 12 scenes wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Re-implemented by:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;     Kaleidos Junior\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/z7ccx2iTGGzF62AU-l162gChQDQ=/0x0/pic530545.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/f7R9bMRK00Yy5LxQdg2FuAFs_Po=/fit-in/200x150/pic530545.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":12,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1994,"bggRating":5.9343,"averageRating":6.72021,"rank":2477,"__v":0}

In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated \u0026quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it's over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you've lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.\u0026quot;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What's the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you're first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A later-developed game directly inspired by Barbarossa is  Dominic Crapuchettes' Cluzzle.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/aStZdAzqXJSe8gWUeHrBdmY_AEc=/0x0/pic1152337.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/gt3vbNYlAsxZkpeY_JMmqiofYzA=/fit-in/200x150/pic1152337.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1988,"bggRating":5.93899,"averageRating":6.37508,"rank":2452,"__v":0}

This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/j9_kvliT3iCJlodSLcLcQSOH25A=/0x0/pic166866.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/uqBP8TmGc283rJqBj5JJ2V1sZrA=/fit-in/200x150/pic166866.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1999,"bggRating":6.06339,"averageRating":6.94325,"rank":1947,"__v":0}

Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.

Players do not own any horse.  Rather, they each have three betting chips.  On a player's turn, she/he rolls a die and moves one of the five horses forward based on the result of the roll.  The race track pictured on the board has two lanes.  These lanes are used by the player to keep track of which horses have been moved in the current turn. At the start of a turn all of the horses shall be in the same lane. Then as a player moves the horses forward, he/she also moves them to the other lane. The player continues until they've rolled five times and moved each horse once.  The lane from where the horses started the turn will be empty.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;That's simple enough.  But before each turn, players are allowed to place a bet on a horse (starting with the rolling player).  After a person places a bet (e.g. \u0026quot;I'll back the green horse\u0026quot;) the next player can choose to or not to place a bet.  This continues until all players decline to place a betting chip.  Then the player starts rolling and moving horses.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Eventually, three horses will cross the finish line and will pay out for win, place, or show positions.  The player who first placed a bet on the winning horse claims the greatest payoff.  Payoffs diminish the longer a player waited to support a horse (e.g. the second person to bet on the horse that ultimately wins pays less than the first player to back the second-place horse).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The constant wait-and-see is agonizing.

The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player\u0026rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player\u0026rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players\u0026rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent\u0026rsquo;s card.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four \u0026ldquo;King\u0026rsquo;s Favor\u0026rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent\u0026rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/gU0bpgCaYWRrK3ZfOn3mMGtygsg=/0x0/pic48675.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/4TuEfjs-GIt_YJYKibeMgPfdvBQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic48675.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1999,"bggRating":5.46308,"averageRating":4.79545,"rank":15697,"__v":0}

Typically, dice are used to resolve conflicts between troops, however a deck of battle cards are used instead, which captures the feel of conflict much better and gives approximately the same results seemingly without the bitterness that accompanies skewed die rolls.  And lastly, the overall ebb and flow of the game is determined through the play of strategy cards, which ostensibly mark certain historical events during the Revolutionary War, but each card has multiple purposes depending on which side is attempting to use it.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A complete game of WE THE PEOPLE includes:\u0026#10;One 16\u0026quot; x 22\u0026quot; Map\u0026#10;50 Round Playing Pieces\u0026#10;14 Rectangular Playing Pieces\u0026#10;66 Hexagonal Playing Pieces\u0026#10;2 Square Playing Pieces\u0026#10;One 8 1/2\u0026quot; x 11\u0026quot; Player Reference Card\u0026#10;One Rules Booklet\u0026#10;One Historical Commentary Booklet\u0026#10;96 Strategy Cards\u0026#10;64 Battle Cards\u0026#10;13 Plastic General Stands\u0026#10;One 6-sided Die\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/awp9Z3-Z1LcIsAImrwc21QK9cSI=/0x0/pic289191.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/YAgD02Qlq7sWgPMYhZOB5vZEHSE=/fit-in/200x150/pic289191.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1993,"bggRating":6.3482,"averageRating":7.30806,"rank":1192,"__v":0}

The deck contains the four regular suits, but each has 2 Kings, 2 Queens and 3 Jacks, 3 '10's and 3 '9's. There are also four jokers, which \u0026#10;count as the highest trump. At the end of each hand, the players score a point for each trick made, with a\u0026#10;bonus of ten if you make exactly as many tricks as you bid. If you bid zero and made no tricks, you score\u0026#10;20 points - which makes zero very valuable. The game ends when any player reaches 77 points at the end\u0026#10;of a hand: the player with the most points wins.  Each hand starts with dealing out the entire deck. Each\u0026#10;player uses one face down card as a bid for the trump suit.  If one suit has more cards than any other,\u0026#10;this suit becomes trumps for the hand. If not, the hand is played as No Trumps. There is a clear trade-off\u0026#10;here between getting the suit you want as trumps and retaining as many cards as possible in the suit.\u0026#10;However, it can also be a useful way of reducing your holding in a particular suit. Or even throwing away \u0026#10;a high card that would otherwise win a trick, if you are going to bid zero tricks.  Once the trump suit has \u0026#10;been determined, each player, starting to the left of dealer, states how many tricks they expect to take.\u0026#10;This gives an interesting advantage to the dealer.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/9wXbAmnnPq37TuQlo880WP97xvk=/0x0/pic45148.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/eLMc9T12DLkP91w48qvV32KcEx0=/fit-in/200x150/pic45148.jpg","minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":0,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.25294,"rank":-1,"__v":0}

Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.\u0026quot;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat\u0026mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit \u0026mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly\u0026mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.\u0026quot;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.\u0026quot;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . .

If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, \u0026quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?\u0026quot; The answer \u0026quot;neither\u0026quot; is NEVER allowed.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Variant:\u0026#10;The 2003 version of this game \u0026quot;Would You Rather?\u0026quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Typical questions include \u0026quot;Would you rather ...

Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.

The strategy comes in figuring out how to use your opponent's ships as sacrifices in getting your ships around the black holes.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Awards\u0026#10;\u0026#10;1999 Vuoden Perhepeli\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/t3jgTskVoOWfYSVK-PY7-bMA0pA=/0x0/pic362001.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/j8PW_Bg6efhFJoV5-fZl5kfQERw=/fit-in/200x150/pic362001.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1999,"bggRating":5.59204,"averageRating":5.95246,"rank":6641,"__v":0}

Each player controls a team of townsfolk, which they promote as the new leaders of Keytown. In the \u0026lsquo;olden days\u0026rsquo; (in the game Keydom), these teams specialized in different activities: mining, fishing, forestry, brewing, and farming. With the passing of time, the townsfolk became skilled in each of these activities. They then aspired to gain further skills and experience as churchmen, councillors, and tradesmen. With these new skills came seniority, prestige, and high standing amongst their peers.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In the game, the townsfolk and their seniority are represented by numbered tiles. Keytown is played over four rounds. Each round represents a generation in the lives of the townsfolk, during which the townsfolk may work or study in the resource locations, gain new skills in the church, council, or market, or start a family in a cottage. After four generations, one of these teams is destined to emerge as the new leaders of Keytown. The winner of the game is the player whose townsfolk are collectively held in the most esteem at the end of round four.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Like Keydom, contents include full colour board, printed counters, and wooden cubes.

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending \u0026quot;megabucks\u0026quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Expanded by:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1\u0026#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2\u0026#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Re-published as:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Illuminati:  Deluxe Edition\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;CCG Version:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Illuminati: New World Order\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Magazine Articles:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)\u0026#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.\u0026#10;    \u0026#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)\u0026#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.\u0026#10;    \u0026#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)\u0026#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.\u0026#10;    \u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/DRXGRLLJG9ySKNBwNItKDhRtkeg=/0x0/pic55406.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/mtVBeyyKY5Tw5PBucobCaJhzcY4=/fit-in/200x150/pic55406.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1982,"bggRating":5.90862,"averageRating":6.18164,"rank":2609,"__v":0}

The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/eINLh_ZSy7lm_MfE7qOf615jUA0=/0x0/pic713985.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/65I8ggBYq8IRdaSNqXdfJPFU2uM=/fit-in/200x150/pic713985.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":240,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1999,"bggRating":7.0643,"averageRating":7.74062,"rank":300,"__v":0}

The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted \u0026quot;tennis ball\u0026quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.

If you don't like the way something is going, you can fight other players for control with your cowboys.  You can rob the bank, rustle cattle, and shoot those pesky farmers!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gameplay:  To Start each player receives a set of colored player counters, matching turn order token, and two black action tokens and either $20 or $25 depending on number of players.  The dice are rolled to determine the start player. Each player in turn order will place one of their cowboy counters in a town box of any of the 5 towns on the map until each player has placed 3 cowboys.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each turn the players will bid for turn order, take actions and move the turn marker one space.  To bid for turn order each player places an amount of money under their turn order token in current player order.  Players may either raise or drop out.  If a player drops out all money bid so far is paid to the bank and their turn order token is placed in the furthest available spot from start player space on the turn order track.  This continues until one player remains and becomes the start player for the round.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;During the action phase each player will take 1 action in turn order.  After everyone has taken a turn they repeat the procedure.  The actions available are limited in number so turn order is important in doing what a player wishes to do.  Actions available are: Buy Cattle in a town containing their cowboy(s), Purchase more Cowboys, Move Cowboys to different towns, Move Cattle from one town to another, Purchase Buildings or Transport counters in a town, Take a Farmer(reduces income and victory points from Cattle in the town they are placed), or Gunfight.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are six different building and transport counters: StageCoach (these earn $1 per cowboy when cowboys are placed in or moved from the town containing the player's StageCoach), Train (this doubles the income gained from all players Cattle in the same town and doubles victory points gained from Cattle at game end),  Bank (earns its owner $2 for each building or transport counter in the same town), Store (earns the owner $1 for each Cattle counter belonging to other players in the town and $2 per Farmer counter in town),  Hotel (earns $1 for each cowboy belonging to other players in same town), Jail (the sheriff in the Jail acts as an extra cowboy controlled by owner that can be added to Gunfights). Cattle and Farmers also earn money for players during an income round.  Each Cattle counter earns its owner $2 UNLESS the town also contains a Farmer (it only earns $1 if this is the case).  Oh, the Farmer and Cowmen can't be friends.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gunfights can be started to take over another players Building or Tranport counter, rustle Cattle, rob a Bank or remove a Farmer or Jail.  The player choosing the Gunfight selects the target of the attack.  All Cowboys belonging to each player in the town will be involved.  The remaining player's Cowboys in the town are not involved. However; the owner of the Jail can choose to help themselves, if they are attacking, or they can add the Sheriff to the defender if wished.  Farmers that are attacked defend as a single cowboy.  Banks and Trains both have an intrinsic 1 Cowboy defense in addition to those in town of owner's color.  The player with the fewest Cowboys fires first and immediately removes casualties.  Each 5 or 6 rolled kills a Cowboy.  If the number of Cowboys is tied then firing is simultaneous.  A player may retreat instead of firing by moving each cowboy involved to a different town (only 1 per town) and loses the engagement.  If the attacker wins they take control of the target of the attack and may replace the counter (up to 2 counters if rustling Cattle) with one of their color (except for Banks, Farmers and Jails).  A Jail or Farmer is removed from play and a Bank is robbed.  The successful robber rolls 3 die 6 and takes that amount of money from the owner of the Bank (the Bank remains under owner's control).  If the owner of the Bank cannot pay the full amount (then pays all they have to the robber and the Bank is removed).  Each time a player wins a Gunfight they take a Wanted Counter.  If none remain they take it from another player their of choice.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Victory:  After taking turns 3,6,9 and 12 income is paid to players as delineated above.  The game ends after round 12.  Victory points are awarded for each Building or Transport counter (1 point per size of town).  So a building in a Town with 4 Building or Transport Counters including itself is worth 4 points to the owning player.  Each Cattle Counter is worth one victory point for the owner.  If a train is in the town each Cattle Counter is worth 2 points.  If a Farmer is in the town Cattle are worth 1 victory point less.  To illustrate, if a Farmer is in same town Cattle counters are worthless unless a Train is also present in the town.  In this case, they would be worth 1 point each.  The player with the most Building/Transport counters and Cattle in a town is considered to control the town and scores bonus points equal to the size of the town (Cattle do not affect town size but do affect control).  The Player with most money gains 5 victory points (2 each in case of a tie).  The Player with the most Wanted counters scores 4 victory points.  The player with most Points wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/4vmTNL54b1KTZi_tj2ZTOjTU2FU=/0x0/pic198418.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/267r6S7pC3JPNdwkoSxcia1Vi3w=/fit-in/200x150/pic198418.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2000,"bggRating":5.73502,"averageRating":6.15598,"rank":3841,"__v":0}

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game changes the base game in three main ways:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/fnZmueQkDuddB5WC3eXQgBVTFvM=/0x0/pic2420315.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/md4I7PPXsa2BtfG2BwlxYUAnA7k=/fit-in/200x150/pic2420315.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":7.22497,"averageRating":7.46227,"rank":-1,"__v":0}

If the number asked is correct, the questioner receives those cards and play passes to the\u0026#10;answering player. Sets of six rumors collected are placed on the table and score three points. At any point, a player may guess which rumor group is missing, scoring 10 points \u0026#10;for a correct guess and taking a penalty of 5 points for an incorrect guess.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/tGt0LD-H8EkLAdHoCBtFQRv1-MQ=/0x0/pic72079.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/_K0aBTf2MoGt6m66975xUe5x4_o=/fit-in/200x150/pic72079.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":7,"playingTime":20,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2000,"bggRating":5.47311,"averageRating":5.06071,"rank":15375,"__v":0}

If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;If a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card.

Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack.

TwixT is a \u0026quot;connection-type\u0026quot; game, very similar to Hex. Other related games are Havannah and The Game of Y. \u0026quot;Connection type\u0026quot; means the object is to form a path connecting something to something else. This requires very different thinking from the standard battle-type game such as chess or checkers.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Some old US sets mention a 4-player variant, with 2 teams as in Bridge, but this probably wasn't Randolph's idea.  The game was popular in the 60s and 70s as part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Avalon Hill then acquired the series and issued the game themselves. Several European publishers have sold the game as well.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Twixt employs a pegboard, pegs and links.  The playing surface is a 24x24 square pegboard, usually minus the corner holes, with two opposite sides marked with one player's color and the other two sides marked with the other player's color.  Each player has a supply of pegs and links of their color.  50 of each piece type of each color, a total of 200, is an ample supply. Players alternate turns placing pegs and links, if possible, in attempt to have a continuous path of links connecting the two sides of the board with their color.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;After the 3M edition, Randolph added the pie rule. After the first peg is placed, the opponent has the option to swap sides. This reduces the imbalance from the first move advantage.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;On your turn you place one peg of your color on the board, and then add or rearrange your color links. Pegs may be placed in any vacant hole in the board except the corners and the last row on the sides of the opposing player. When two pegs of the same color are at opposite corners of a six hole rectangle (3x2 or 2x3), a link may be placed between those two pegs.  Links may not be placed such that they cross other links.  Multiple links may be added on a single move. Usually, all links are to the peg just placed, but on your move you are allowed to remove as many of your own links as you wish, and add your own links anywhere on the board as long as they are legal as described here.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When a player connects his two sides with a continuous path of links, he prevents his opponent from doing the same, the game is over, and the player connecting his two sides wins the game. If neither side can complete such a path, the game is a draw.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/4XyIFK44fTaEy_8zTgyG8UZcUEM=/0x0/pic146608.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/BUWfaqw-fJP8Nq4p17ilzllW0cE=/fit-in/200x150/pic146608.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":30,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1962,"bggRating":6.17187,"averageRating":6.60255,"rank":1618,"__v":0}

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.

The cards show the lengths they may move from 0 to 4 including half lengths, e.g. 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5 etc. Shifting lanes costs 1 length, but the Sulky only moves forward a half length. As with many such games, the inside lane has fewer spaces on the bend than the outside lanes. But if you are blocked in and cannot move, you miss your go completely. Taking the inside line therefore is quicker, but makes it easier for others to block you. Each player also has a Joker and Gallop card to help themselves and hinder others once in the game. The races are meant to be quick and the designer encourages betting on them, but doesn't give a method.

Movement to targets is through zones. Die rolls and game tables determine appearance, type, and position of enemy fighters. Charts are used to determine if hits are made, where the damage is located, and how serious the damage is.  Game tables and die rolls also determine everything from the bomber's target and formation position to weather, flak, and German fighter opposition as the B-17 makes its way over land and sea to its target.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game has a low complexity and typically, the playing time is generally less than one hour after your first few games.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;B-17 is designed to be primarily a solitaire game. The player controls a B-17F Flying Fortress bomber, trying to survive German fighter attacks and drop its load of bombs on the selected target, then return home safely. Optionally, a second player can control the German fighters (to some degree; their appearance is determined randomly, but successive attacks are under the control of the German player).

In Gunslinger, you play the part of a western character who is caught in a sudden gunfight, and you face the split-second decisions and incidents of the showdown as bullets start to fly.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gunslinger is based on a quick and easy game system that recreates the split-second nature of gunplay. Each turn the players secretly play cards to define exactly what they will do during the next two seconds in the game. Then they step through these actions on the playing map, resolving each shot in the split-second when it takes place. Gunslinger resolves combat quickly and easily. The attacker draws a result card that shows exactly where his shot hits, which combines with his gun to determine the damage he inflicts. This recreates the critical differences between weapons: Winchesters, Shotguns, Buffalo rifles, Colt's \u0026quot;Peacemaker\u0026quot;, Smith \u0026amp; Wesson's breakopen guns and Remington's Derringer are a few of the guns in the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gunslinger includes eight two-sided boards (a total of sixteen map faces) portraying town and countryside terrain at a scale of six feet per hex.

The terrain includes gullies, hills, trees, watering troughs, wells, hitching posts and the interiors of buildings.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Gunslinger presents 26 different gunfights and several hundred variations, including both historical gunfights and made-up situations. Wild Bill Hickok, Billy the Kid, Wyatt Earp, and John Wesley Hardin are just a few of the real gunslingers of history who appear in re-creations of the gunfights that made them famous.

The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a \u0026quot;showdown\u0026quot; in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).\u0026#10;Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)\u0026#10;Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).\u0026#10;Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). \u0026#10;Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)\u0026#10;Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).\u0026#10;Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).\u0026#10;Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).\u0026#10;One Pair:  A pair of cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, K, Q, J).\u0026#10;High Card:  High card without any other higher combination (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Poker has many variants.  The two main forms of Poker are: Stud Poker and Draw Poker.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In Draw Poker, all cards are dealt face down to each player.  One of the most played  versions of Draw Poker is Five (5) card Draw Poker (often shown in TV and Motion Pictures).  Each player is dealt five (5) cards.  There is a betting interval, and those left in the deal, may trade cards in their hand for new cards from the stock (IE: Discard two cards, and receive two new cards from the dealer).  There is then a final betting interval before the showdown.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In Stud Poker, some of the cards are dealt face down, and some are exposed for all players to see.  One of the most common games of Stud Poker is Seven (7) card Stud Poker.  Each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up.  After the first betting interval, each remaining player is dealt another card face up.  This continues two more times, with a betting interval before each deal, until all players that remain have two cards face down, and four cards face up.  Each player then receives a final card face down, and there is a final betting interval before the showdown.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Currently, one of the most popular versions of Poker is a version of Stud Poker called Texas Hold'Em.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;No-Limit Texas Hold'Em is the version used in The World Series of Poker each year.  Each player is dealt two cards face down.  After a betting interval, three community cards are dealt face up at the same time.  There is another betting interval, and another community card is dealt face up; after another betting interval, another community card is dealt face up.  There is then another betting interval before the showdown.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/Z87dKNf_VtJMvqoF6ejjHcbBfIk=/0x0/pic186610.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/vwy7z2qT7CRqQo32WrNrtNyJq98=/fit-in/200x150/pic186610.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":10,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1810,"bggRating":6.49713,"averageRating":6.70119,"rank":917,"__v":0}

Players can compete against one another, or work cooperatively. Like any good multiplayer game, there are alliances and treacherous betrayals among the players. In the end, in order to defeat the evil lord in his castle (the main objective of the game) at least some of the players will need to team up because the castle lord is more powerful than any one character can handle.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Evidently the publisher had visions of making a whole series of games based on the R.A.G.G.S.

There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comess when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.

The Rook deck is similar to a standard deck of cards, but has only numbers from 1-14 in four colors (no face cards or card suits (spades, etc.)).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The standard game is a 4-player partnership game with the 1's, 2's, 3's, and 4's removed for a deck of 41 cards (with the Rook card).  Each hand, players bid for Trump, and then the partnership that won the bid must make the amount of points bid in the hand.  Play of each trick is similar to Whist games like Bridge. The card led must be followed by a card of the same color.  A player may play a trump color if they have none of the color led.  The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless the trick is trumped, and then the highest trump wins the trick.  The Rook card can be played at any time, and always wins the trick.  Unlike Whist or Bridge, the amount of tricks is not important, but certain count cards (5's, 10's, 14's, and the Rook card) taken in tricks are worth points, which is how the game is scored.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The standard game is 4-player, but there are variants for 2-player and 3-player in the rules, and there also are many variations and house rules used in play.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Rook has also been referred to as Missionary Poker.

The 20th anniversary edition is a deluxe version of the game with a large color game instruction book, quality game board, and six sets of different colored glass markers that allows play with up to 6 players.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Other five-in-a-row games include Go-Moku and Renju (which do not feature capturing), and Ninuki-Renju (which does).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Similar to:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    5ive Straight\u0026#10;    Take 5\u0026#10;    5 in a Row\u0026#10;    Go-Moku\u0026#10;    Renju\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/yNvbreIhtjFDYQUqpoIYTsOIJzs=/0x0/pic1476333.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/sI-PvMHuXFX2ezII3b1P13yj0Us=/fit-in/200x150/pic1476333.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1977,"bggRating":6.21599,"averageRating":6.63331,"rank":1506,"__v":0}

(Merciless!) is a game in which players enter a prospecting boom town and try to accumulate the most prestige points. Rather than doing the dirty work themselves, players hire adventurers to pan for their gold, fight their gun battles, and sit in for them in the poker games. Since the money hasn't yet come in, these rough-tough folk are hired merely with pieces of paper - IOUs. But on pay day the IOUs come due, and if a player can't pay off debts, then the vultures swoop in.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players bid for adventurer cards that will be used in various events - Gold Fever, High Noon, and the Poker Game. Each adventurer carries a number (a rating) for each of the three events. When it's time to play out an event, players place an adventurer card face down. All players simultaneously turn the cards over. The adventurer with the highest number pertaining to the event wins; the lowest loses (ties are usually kept as ties, with both receiving the benefits or penalties). In Gold Fever the winner and second highest receive gold, which may be exchanged for prestige points or used to pay off debts. In High Noon, the winner gets to pick back up two IOUs (not necessarily his or her own); the loser is shot and loses the adventurer card. Also the undertaker advances one space along a timing track. In the Poker Game, the winner moves forward on the prestige track; the loser moves backwards. The IOU cards used in bids for the adventurers are placed in rows along the board, each beside one of six dice symbols (showing 1 through 6). When as many rows as there are players in the game are filled, it's Pay Day. A die is rolled and the outermost card beside the corresponding die symbol is turned up. The player who owns that IOU must pay up. This continues until either all cards of one die symbol have been turned up, or a player cannot meet a debt. The unfortunate player in this case gets a vulture chip and moves back 5 spaces on the prestige track. The game ends either when one player has 3 vulture chips; a player reaches or passes the winning space on the prestige track; or the undertaker reaches his final space. When the game ends the player farthest along the prestige track wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/dPKRkHTJAEKhyJQP4k5MRzDu1us=/0x0/pic767870.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/7IYSrclyhs2jmf1SXGvay4C8-vQ=/fit-in/200x150/pic767870.jpg","minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2001,"bggRating":5.59466,"averageRating":5.94748,"rank":6537,"__v":0}

As the thief, you secretly plot your movements around a private art museum.  As you go, the detectives take turns trying to find you with their eyes, the video cameras, or motion detectors.  You can deactivate the cameras, and you can even cut off the power to the entire museum to mask your movements.  Another advantage is that the thief gets a turn after every detective's individual turn.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Another problem for the detectives is the fact that, once the thief has picked up a painting, she can take her next turn before removing the painting from the gameboard.  The good guys know the vicinity, but won't know her exact location, as the thief is now up to 3 squares away from that spot. If a detective ever spots you with the naked eye, secret movement is over, and the thief's token is placed on the board for all to see.  This can get frantic, since the thief can only move 1-3 spaces, while detectives roll a d6 for movement!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The thief player has to decide when to attempt a getaway. The catch is, some of the windows and doors are locked.  There are actual lock pieces, and you must flip over the one you are attempting to open (instant detective frenzy!). If she has stolen 3 paintings (in a one-off game), and manages to get out, she wins.

It simulates the politics of the Roman Senate during the republic.  The players take the part of various factions vying for the control of the senate.  They control the various powerful families of the time, who compete for state offices, military command, economic concessions and new adherents.  To win the player must get their faction to become the most powerful in Rome.  While doing this, however, a balance must be maintained.  A hostile world situation, and the vagaries of the public of Rome means that the players must also cooperate so that Rome herself doesn't go down under this pressure.  If Rome does not last, neither does the senate, and all players lose!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Players make proposals to the Senate which other players then vote on. A player's ability to make proposals is determined by which Offices his/her Senators hold. A player's influence in votes is determined by the number of Senators they have recruited and the level of influence those Senators have obtained. Proposals may include assigning Senators to governor provinces (generating revenue), recruiting an army to fight an external foe, addressing the concerns of the Roman people, assigning offices or prosecuting previous office holders. Players have to co-operate to overcome the various threats that the game sends against Rome (wars, famine, unrest, bankruptcy) whilst working to build their own Senators' and Generals' positions and undermine that of their opponents. A powerful General or an influential Senator may become Emperor (thus winning the game) but equally may suddenly fall to the plague or an assassin's blade.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/d-ea6v2G86uJxjduZ9GOMgE5f2I=/0x0/pic487045.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/z7u-HztO4Is2m07SRh4F97Us0fY=/fit-in/200x150/pic487045.jpg","minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":300,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1990,"bggRating":6.98143,"averageRating":7.55338,"rank":371,"__v":0}

The game was created by Jim Barnes who sold the game at a booth that he set up at Indy and other race track promenades in the 1970s. Mr. Barnes struck a deal with Avalon Hill and the game was changed a little by the development team at AH and published with the SI logo on the box.  On an oval track you can run up to 33 cars. Each car has its own driver card derived from the performance of the actual drivers of the featured Indy race. Ongais, Foyt, Unser, Sneva, Mears, Rutherford etc, every driver that was in the that year's Indy has a card with a color photo on one side and game racing charts on the other side.  One Card set, for an even year Indy race from 1978 through 1986, was included in the box with the other card sets offered through the AH mail order program.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each driver card has 6 tables on the back. Three of the tables for movement, you chose whether you are going to drive normally, charge or back off and then roll 2 dice, referencing the appropriate table. The result will tell you how far you can move or if you have encountered car trouble. There are 2 trouble tables that can slow you down or knock you out of the race. There is also a pit stop table which controls how many turns you must sit in the pits before re-entering the race.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game is driven on Stats and can be played solitaire.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/V6TtQ5X_lfUUltWIGvQIypgF2vs=/0x0/pic52503.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/DNCxQsg43evU-guPwhhXyK7HinU=/fit-in/200x150/pic52503.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":33,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1979,"bggRating":5.51265,"averageRating":5.82222,"rank":12441,"__v":0}

Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/s8UFzMGvlClD-5SUlLaEMJ4pnmo=/0x0/pic1296903.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/XszSCEyCTH5_V6JFqJXDJHml4q8=/fit-in/200x150/pic1296903.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":10,"playingTime":45,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":5.43645,"averageRating":4.34559,"rank":16181,"__v":0}

The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. \u0026#10;The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/4HZ_xWTPAVXALkF9agvyOzyosb4=/0x0/pic7498.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/tlNtbPa-_ZCvRqKY1IGocCHbwFM=/fit-in/200x150/pic7498.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":45,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1998,"bggRating":5.47957,"averageRating":5.20988,"rank":15089,"__v":0}

The heart of the game is the \u0026quot;BattleMech\u0026quot;: a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 'Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). 'Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own 'Mechs from scratch. The game is typically played on one or more mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play. An extensive line of pewter figurines ('Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of core rulebooks, the central one being Total Warfare, which contains the main rules for the game (the 2018 reprint is up-to-date in terms of errata fixes). TechManual contains construction rules for 'Mechs and other units, for those who want to create their own custom units. A series of four advanced rulebooks expands the game in many different ways: Tactical Operations adds a wide variety of gear and optional rules; Strategic Operations, Interstellar Operations, and Campaign Operations are more esoteric, covering a variety of mass-combat rulesets, rules for running your own mercenary units, and unusual equipment. The final core rulebook available is A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;BT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on 'Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history; map sets, including the new Hex Pack hard-mounted maps with tile overlays; sourcebooks; and pregenerated record sheets, as well as the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.

However, aside from the artwork and the piece names, the game only bears a superficial resemblance to either the movie or Tolkien's works.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each player chooses a character from the Fellowship.

However, to win the game, a player must have at least one Ring when they reach Mount Doom.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Cards allow a player to move 1-3 clear spaces ahead, to defeat Orcs or Nazgul, to bypass the various opposing creatures on the board, or to traverse mountain terrain, dictate movement.

Each player has a hand of 5 cards with which to play the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Die rolling comes into play for fighting Orcs, Nazgul, Shelob and Gollum when you don't have a card to defeat (or escape from) them, or to traverse the mountains.

At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Similar to:\u0026#10;\u0026#10;    Drinkers Wild\u0026#10;    Lovers Wild\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/mscUE8If_J4GV3BrRGvU_2-eFz0=/0x0/pic243271.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/bwkwFvDzkr_tEb-5SsBr1NgQg4U=/fit-in/200x150/pic243271.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":120,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1978,"bggRating":5.46686,"averageRating":5.00548,"rank":15575,"__v":0}

The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;One optional element in Clue: Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a \u0026quot;claw-marked\u0026quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/dbUG7svIozapIEcgVNliewyb9V8=/0x0/pic1644290.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/vtetv8RZzg5PUpox46C_ReZ29Y0=/fit-in/200x150/pic1644290.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":2001,"bggRating":5.54111,"averageRating":5.84719,"rank":9560,"__v":0}

Once all players have completed the round, each 30 min slot awards money to the top-rated network, with ex-aequos splitting the money. The process is repeated for Saturday and Sunday. When going around the board again, visiting an owned show space forces a payout to the owner. Finally, the Sunday round is followed by an additional weekend scoring, where the ratings across all three nights are summed and compared. The richest network wins.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Note that when one rolls doubles, one either moves ahaead the full die score, or one goes backward by the single die score. This adds strategy.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game was later republished by Avalon Hill as TV Wars (q.v.), but the latter's rules are considerably different.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/y9K_xyAcA3QQt_cp1_c5cIVrsvw=/0x0/pic4696.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/jHOPv9R-5nEIPbKC1TzswFrWJ8I=/fit-in/200x150/pic4696.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1979,"bggRating":0,"averageRating":6.28182,"rank":-1,"__v":0}

Shuffle those all together and deal them out so each person has 4 cards. They can't look at them until the game starts though. Place spoons on the table (enough for all except one player). Position them fairly, so each person pretty much has the same chance to grab one. You have one person (this job rotates hand to hand) start calling out 'pass'. How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point.

There were 9 games in this series, which were released near the end of the 3M venture into the gaming market.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game is extremely simple, yet requires quite a bit of 'bluffing' in order to win.  Each player begins with six metal pawns along the back row of a 6x6 grid.  The board fits snuggly into the box itself and is quite sturdy.  The game is, as is the entire Gamette series, ideal for bringing along while traveling.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each player secretly places a teeny magnet under two of his pawns.  The object is to be the first player to maneuver one of these 'magnet-bearing' pawns to the opposite side of the board.  If you manage to accomplish this feat, you win.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Movement is simple.  You simply move one of your pawns one space to an adjacent space ... vertically, horizontally or diagonally.  If this lands you atop an opponent's pawn, you are both 'frozen' and can no longer move.  If you make the mistake of moving one of your 'magnet' pawns onto an opponent, he instantly wins.  \u0026quot;Well\u0026quot;, you say, \u0026quot;Why wouldn't I just check the pawn to make sure it wasn't carrying a magnet before making such a questionable move?\u0026quot;.  The rules allow for this, but if you do check, you are prohibited from 'freezing' an opponent that round.  So, it's best to remember which two of your pawns are carrying magnets.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As mentioned, the game ends as soon as one player manages to get a magnet-bearing pawn to the opposite side of the board.  If both players fail to accomplish this, the game is a draw.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The game is very simple and the primary tactic is 'bluff'.  Are you going to be bold and move one of your 'magnet' pawns to the front, figuring your opponent will guess that this cannot possibly be your magnet pawn as he could freeze it too easily?  Or, do you protect your magnet pawns and try to create a path that it can squeeze by your opponent's pawns and scoot to the opposite side?  As with most bluff-style games, there's some guesswork and plain old luck involved, but there is still enough maneuvering and tactics to keep it interesting.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/cpyajUfnFezaScnBOWSER5Z44mE=/0x0/pic171975.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/46ie0vNOC1T8jR7DVOUlQalMno0=/fit-in/200x150/pic171975.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":10,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1971,"bggRating":5.51106,"averageRating":5.81613,"rank":12593,"__v":0}

Their slow climb up the rocky slopes to the foreboding tower at the summit seemed to last an eternity. At last the figures escaped the storm and entered a dark hallway. As they peered into the shadows, they saw a sinister figure on a rocky throne. A solitary traveler stepped forward from the huddled and dripping group and addressed the presence on the throne. My lord Morcar, we come bearings grave tidings. We must report the failure of your plan to raise the Ogre Horde against the Empire. Once again we were routed by his accursed Champions and once again we were forced to flee. The figure on the throne shifted and a voice like death broke the silence. I am aware of your failure, Festral. But as in all things I have learned from my failures. Firstly I have learned not to underestimate the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s Heroes. Secondly, I have learned not to rely on fools. I have therefore conceived a new scheme to destroy the Emperor\u0026rsquo;s Heroes forever. I have chosen four Lieutenants to carry out my plan. Come forth my Lieutenants. With that command, four silhouettes stepped from the shadows. Let me present Zanrath, High Mage of Sarako. An ancient bearded man wearing a pointed hat and carrying a staff topped with a crescent moon bowed down towards Festral and his retinue. Fanrax, the Malicious. At the mention of his name, an evil-looking man adorned with skull symbols and toying with a wickedly sharp dagger gave a sneering smile at the group. Boroush, the Storm Master. With sweep of his oaken staff, a ragged and bearded figure greeted the refugees. And finally, Grawshak, Orc Shaman of the Northern Tribes. The last of the four Lieutenants, an Orc decorated in skins, feathers and skulls, carrying a massive totem wand growled what might have been a greeting or a curse at the party. I believe that these four Sorcerers will succeed where you have so miserably failed. And it is they who will punish you for your failure. With this final word, Morcar disappeared into the shadows.

You stock your deck with at least 20 points of stories (usually 3 or 4) and try to get the required cards into play.  As an example The card 'A Day in the Life of a M. U. Student' requires you to visit 3 Different Miskatonic University Locations, cast a spell, summon a monster, go to a country site and play an ally of the opposite sex.

In this card's case you score 8 points and gain 2 sanity.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The types of cards you have are locations (you almost always occupy one), allies, monsters, events, tomes, spells, artifacts and adventures.  A round lasts until there are two passes, at which time all monsters played fight each other then go after the investigators to disable their allies or reduce their sanity.  You can throw allies in front of the monsters as cannon fodder to protect your investigator.  You then decide what cards you are going to keep in your hand (each investigator has a minimum and a maximum number of cards that must be kept) and draw back to 13 for the next round.  Because of this you blow through your deck very quickly and you will go through it a couple of times in most games.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There are also some very nasty phobias and events to play on your opponents to interfere with their strategies.

If your boat stops in a space that is adjacent to 1 or more others, bumping occurs. To determine where your boat ends up you look at the hex sides facing each other (on your boat and on the adjacent one(s)). You subtract the adjacent boat's hex side number from yours - and if it is positive your boat moves forward that number of spaces, and if negative - the other boat moves forward that number of spaces.

First published in the mid-'70s it was way ahead of its time. The game works by alternating stock dealing rounds and operating rounds. Stock dealing rounds allow players to buy shares in the available railway companies. Operating rounds allow the presidents of those companies to build track, run trains \u0026amp; generate revenue for shareholders.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;This basic system has been much copied and is an integral part of all 18xx games.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The original board covered the southern half of Britain, from the south coast to Darlington. In 1981 a northern board was published covering northern Britain \u0026amp; Scotland.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Where 1829 differs from most others in the 18xx series is the means by which track is laid. Companies each have a token on the board called a Survey Party. Track is laid by moving the company's Survey token and placing a track tile in the area just vacated... if it is still vacant. This mechanism was discarded in the later 18xx titles, and creates much more of a tactical tile-laying game. It also slows down the game, and 1829 is one of the longer 18xx titles. A typical game can take anything from 4 to 10 hours to play.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In 1994 Francis Tresham published 1825, which is largely a modular version of 1829 with simpler rules and a few other enhancements.

Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or \u0026quot;deprogram\u0026quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds.

Each has specific thematic elements, which are consistent across editions and descendant games.  The other currently legal factions include the Spider, Mantis, and an unaligned ronin stronghold.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The Rokugan setting has been changed over the years by participation in the storyline tournaments for the L5R CCG.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Legend of the Five Rings is different from other collectible card games due to the concept of Clan loyalty.  The Clans of the game are what you build your deck around, and the communities that have built up around the Crane Clan, Lion Clan, etc are the backbone of the game.  When you say \u0026quot;I'm a Crab player\u0026quot; you instantly find yourself with hundreds and thousands of clan-mates who are there to help you become a better player.  When one member of the Clan wins, all benefit.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;L5R was the first CCG to introduce cards that players directly influenced. These are still a core part of the game.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The L5R CCG has spun off a number of related games: \u0026#10;\u0026#10;     Clan War, a miniatures game.\u0026#10;     Diskwars: Legend of the Five Rings, a Rokugan-themed set of the Diskwars tabletop combat game.\u0026#10;     Unpublished Prototype, an as-yet unpublished wargame set in Rokugan.\u0026#10;     Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;\u0026#10;As of 2006, only the CCG and Clan War have had storyline tournaments. Though the RPG players have been heavily involved in the ongoing plot in recent years.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In 2008, L5R held the first \u0026quot;Mega-Game\u0026quot; which incorporated various methods of competition for the Clans and their supporters, not only in CCG form, but in contests (art, writing, poster-design, etc.), community work (charity, fundraising, food-drives), and more. The Dragon Clan ultimately won the first mega-game, and as such earned the privilege of having the next Empress come from their clan.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In 2009, L5R released its first graphic novel, Death at Koten, which also included exclusive story-themed cards for the CCG.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Also in 2009, L5R released The Imperial Gift the first completely free expansion in CCG history.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In 2010 L5R celebrated its 15th Anniversary with many major events, new prizes, more free cards, and a special flashback set that brought back some of the most popular cards in the history of the game. 2010 also saw the largest World Championships event at Gen Con in the past 7 years.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;2011 saw the release of War of Honor, an all new tile-based multiplayer format for L5R that comes with 4 pre-constructed decks.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;In september 2015, AEG and Fantasy Flight Games announced that FFG had bought the L5R brand from AEG and will relaunch the card game as a LCG (non-collectible), with significant rules changes and a new design. The game is to go on hiatus following the release of Evil Portents, the final expansion from AEG, and will be relaunched at Gencon 2017. FFG has also plans to continue the RPG at some point (in what form and with which ruleset is yet unknown).\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/__KtDqh6iA2cRWFtC2S_04_swlQ=/0x0/pic151045.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/WOCedd7b_K_aCQH4H6Ijsp5D360=/fit-in/200x150/pic151045.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":45,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1995,"bggRating":6.37502,"averageRating":7.14088,"rank":1142,"__v":0}

With Xerxes' army temporarily delayed at Thermopylae, the Greek fleet, based at Artemisium, some 50 miles or so directly east of Thermopylae, took the opportunity to attempt to stop the Persians from extending this Line of Communications. In a battle that appears to have extended over two or three days, the Greeks managed to eke out a slim tactical win. However, when Thermopylae fell, Themistocles' position became untenable, and the Greek fleet retreated to anchorage in the narrow channel of the Bay of Eleusis, west of Athens, at Salamis.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;With her naval flanks secured, the Persians rolled into lower Greece, capturing Athens and razing the town. However, to complete his subjugation of Greece, Xerxes had to destroy their fleet. To that end, the Persians sailed to a position south of Salamis.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;At Artemisium the Greeks had learned that, while their crews and marines were superior, the huge disparity in numbers could be telling. Unless they could neutralize this Persian strength.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;To that end, Themistocles lured the huge Persian fleet to attack the Greeks in the Bay of Eleusis, whose entrances were so restrictive as to negate any numerical superiority.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;There were two entrances to the bay. To plug up the western escape hatch, Xerxes dispatched his crack Egyptian squadron. Upon hearing this, Adeimantus and his Corinthians peeled off from the main fleet and sailed to the western mouth to block any Egyptian attempt to gain entrance. This \u0026quot;action\u0026quot; appears to have been a stand off, with both sides \u0026quot;blockading\u0026quot; and not fighting.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;At the eastern entrance, the Greeks deployed in three lines, along a narrow front of about 1800 yards, thus negating Persian numerical superiority. The Persians entered the bay in three long lines astern, which they then turned into nine lines abreast.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;The result was a boarding battle, and this was where the Greeks shone. Despite having half the manpower per ship of the Persians, their weaponry, armor and land-based tactics were superior to that of the Persians. And that superiority resulted in a smashing Greek victory.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Xerxes retired to Thessaly, to try again the next year. The result was a great Greek victory, on land, at Plataea, followed by the Greek victory that completely cut Persian Lines of Communication, at Mycale.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/cxin_wnBP1eU5IV_f9VHW_bVo0g=/0x0/pic79955.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/p22kwawncViIJc3-_RF_SDz2q6k=/fit-in/200x150/pic79955.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":360,"isExpansion":true,"yearPublished":1999,"bggRating":5.5666,"averageRating":6.875,"rank":-1,"__v":0}

Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;Each player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;A player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/original/img/qhjJZYVOZdZPUVRO2MX8fglzLao=/0x0/pic6342.jpg","thumbnail":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/thumb/img/fouEOgKlo1EkdvZpGyChGdHCkwc=/fit-in/200x150/pic6342.jpg","minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":10,"playingTime":60,"isExpansion":false,"yearPublished":1993,"bggRating":5.61679,"averageRating":6.35468,"rank":5847,"__v":0}

The ore has to be transported initially by lorries and also later by barges to the coastal warehouse.  All transport has to be hired and there is always less transport available than required, favouring those who are prepared to take a risk on achieving a quick journey without mishap.  For example there are only 5 barges (always one less than the numbers of players) to encourage competition and load sharing.  You can also force other players to pay you for taking their ore to make up a barge load as all barges have to travel fully laden.  Much depends on how long a journey takes.  New ore can only be obtained by throwing a 1 or a six which also triggers the playing of a production card which can be favourable or not.\u0026#10;\u0026#10;From the coastal warehouse, barges and ships are used to transport ore out to sea to foreign ports to sell to gradually earn the Million Dollars needed to win the game.
